##Navigating to specific Blog:
1. Add Link for BlogItem
2. Add BlogItemDetails Route
3. Make API call for Blog Specific BlogItemDetails

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Add Link for BlogItem

‚û°Ô∏è First, we imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`  
```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```
‚û°Ô∏è Then, we wrapped the blog item div with Link.
This makes the entire blog item clickable.

‚û°Ô∏è We used the to prop to tell React Router which path it should navigate to when the blog is clicked.
In this case, the path is /blogs/:id, and the actual URL becomes something like /blogs/1 based on the blog's id.

```js
<Link to={`/blogs/${id}`} className="blog-item-link">
  {/* Blog content */}
</Link>
```
üìå Now, when the user clicks on a blog item,
the browser URL changes to something like /blogs/1
(based on that blog's ID)

‚úÖ This sets up the navigation.
In the next step, we‚Äôll add a route to display the full blog details.
