##Navigating to specific Blog:
1. Add Link for BlogItem
2. Add BlogItemDetails Route
3. Make API call for Blog Specific BlogItemDetails

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Add Link for BlogItem

‚û°Ô∏è First, we imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`  
```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```
‚û°Ô∏è Then, we wrapped the blog item div with Link.
This makes the entire blog item clickable.

‚û°Ô∏è We used the to prop to tell React Router which path it should navigate to when the blog is clicked.
In this case, the path is /blogs/:id, and the actual URL becomes something like /blogs/1 based on the blog's id.

```js
<Link to={`/blogs/${id}`} className="blog-item-link">
  {/* Blog content */}
</Link>
```
üìå Now, when the user clicks on a blog item,
the browser URL changes to something like /blogs/1
(based on that blog's ID)

‚úÖ This sets up the navigation.
In the next step, we‚Äôll add a route to display the full blog details.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Add BlogItemDetails Route

‚û°Ô∏è In `App.js` or your main routing file, we added a new route for individual blog items.

```js
<Route exact path="/blogs/:id" component={BlogItemDetails} />
```
üõ£Ô∏è Here, /blogs/:id is a dynamic route ‚Äî :id acts like a variable called a route param.

This param captures the id from the URL when a user clicks a blog.

üß† For example:

If the user clicks a blog with id 1, the URL becomes /blogs/1.

React Router matches this path and renders the BlogItemDetails component.

üìå Inside BlogItemDetails, you can access this id param to fetch or display the specific blog details.

‚úÖ This route helps us display details for each specific blog item on a new page.

--- 

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Make API Call for Specific BlogItemDetails

üß© When a component is rendered using `Route`, React Router automatically provides some built-in **props** like:

- `match` ‚Äì info about how the route matched
- `location` ‚Äì current URL info
- `history` ‚Äì browser history methods

‚û°Ô∏è We used `match` to get **route parameters** (in our case, the `id` from `/blogs/:id`).

```js
const { match } = this.props
const { params } = match
const { id } = params
```
üìå Here‚Äôs what happens:

match.params gives us the id that was clicked (e.g., /blogs/3 ‚Üí id = 3)
We use this id to fetch data for that specific blog

üîÑ Making the API Call on Mount
When the component loads (mounts), we call the API using the extracted id.

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.getBlogItemData()
}

getBlogItemData = async () => {
  const { match } = this.props
  const { params } = match
  const { id } = params

  const response = await fetch(`https://apis.ccbp.in/blogs/${id}`)
  const data = await response.json()

  const updatedData = {
    imageUrl: data.image_url,
    title: data.title,
    auther: data.auther,
    avatarUrl: data.avatar_url,
    content: data.content,
    id: data.id,
    topic: data.topic,
  }

  this.setState({ blogData: updatedData })
}

```
We converted snake_case keys from the API to camelCase

We stored the cleaned blog data in the component‚Äôs state using setState

‚úÖ This ensures that each blog page loads and displays its own content based on the URL id.
